[Live Deployment Here](https://ravenous-react20.netlify.app/)


Ravenous is a react based web app that uses the YELP API to gather data and returns it by sorting it as best match, highest rated and most reviewed. This is my implementation of CodeCademy's Ravenous-React Project. 

Feel Free to check the live deployment above as well as the source code!
